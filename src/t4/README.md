Open a terminal on directory: `server` and `learn`

On the server directory execute `yarn` or `npm install` and then run:
`node app`, `yarn start` or `npm start`

_please install node before doing it_

On the learn directory execute `yarn` or `npm install` then `yarn develop` or `npm run develop`.

Now you can check your localhost on port 8000
